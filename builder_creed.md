# OUR BUILDER CREED

## 1. SIMPLICITY
- Good code is simple code.
- Always ask: _What’s the simplest way to do this?_
- Delete anything non-essential.
- Use the simplest tech first before adding complexity.

---

## 2. ART
- Good tech is art-like: **beautiful & durable**.
- Care about every detail.
- Reduce the number of details so you can care about all of them.
- You're not writing code — **you're creating a machine**.

---

## 3. DEPENDENCY POLICY
- Don’t use anything you don’t understand.
- Avoid dependencies unless absolutely essential.
- Prefer native APIs and first-party tools.
- If a library can be replaced with <50 LOC, replace it.

---

## 4. FULL CONTROL
- Vertical integrate everything.
- Know always what's happening to your machine.
- Build modular; Control each module.
