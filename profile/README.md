# MY BUILDER CREED

## 1. SIMPLICITY    ->   _Few parts as possible_
- DELETE ANYTHING NON-ESSENTIAL.
- USE SIMPLEST TECH FIRST.
- IF A LIB CAN BE REPLACED WITH 50<= LOC, REPLACE IT.
- AVOID DEPS UNLESS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.
- DON'T USE ANYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

## 2. ERGONOMICS    ->  _Comfortable to work with_
- CARE ABOUT EVERY DETAIL.
- REFINE IT UNTIL IT FEELS LIKE A **GAME**.
- SHOW, DON'T TELL.
- THINK IN TERMS OF **PROJECTS & MACHINES** NOT HARDWARE/SOFTWARE.

## 3. RELIABILITY   ->  _20y time-proof_
- BUILD AS IF YOUR CREATION HAS TO ENDURE AT LEAST 20y.
- PREFER NATIVE APIs & 1st PARTY TOOLS.
- NEVER OUTSOURCE A CORE PROCESS.
- VERTICAL INTEGRATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. 
- FULL-CONTROL THE TECH STACK.

## 4. MODULARITY    ->  _DIVIDE TO CONQUER_
- BUILD TO SCALE.
- AVOID OVER-EXTENSION.
- DIVIDE PROJECT IN ATOMIC UNITS.
- CENTRALIZE THE CORE; DECENTRALIZE THE EDGES.
