# The Builder Creed

## 1. SIMPLICITY
- Good code is simple code.
- Always ask: _What’s the simplest way to do this?_
- Delete anything non-essential.
- Use the simplest tech first before adding complexity.

---

## 2. ART
- Good work should resemble art: **beautiful & durable**.
- Care about every detail.
- Reduce the number of details so you can care about all of them.
- You're not writing code — **you're creating a machine**.

---

## 3. CLEAN BASE
- Don’t use anything you don’t understand.

---

## 4. DEPENDENCY POLICY
- Avoid dependencies unless absolutely essential.
- Prefer native APIs and first-party tools.
- If a library can be replaced with <50 LOC, replace it.

---

## 5. FULL CONTROL
- Vertical integrate everything.
