# MY BUILDER CREED

## 1. SIMPLIFY
- Always ask: _What’s the simplest way to do X?_
- Delete anything non-essential.
- Use the simplest tech first: SQL > HTML/SVG > CSS > JS/TS > ...
- Care about every detail; Reduce num details to care about all.
- If a library can be replaced with 50=< LOC, replace it.
- Avoid dependencies unless absolutely essential.
- Don’t use anything you don’t understand.
- Prefer native APIs and first-party tools.
---

## 2. GAMIFY
- Good tech must feel like a **Game**:
- Simplicity: Fewest parts as possible -> | Fast | Light | Robust | 
- Ergonomic: Comfortable to use -> | Intuitive | Flexible | Modular |
- Transparent: Know what's happening right away -> | Reactive | Open | Aligned |

## 4. CONTROL
- You're not writing code — **you're creating a machine**.
- Think in terms of **Projects & Machines**, not Hardware/Software.
- Vertical integrate everything.
- Full-control the tech stack.
