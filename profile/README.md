# MY BUILDER CREED

## 1. SIMPLIFY  _Fewest parts as possible_
- Delete anything non-essential. 
- Use the simplest tech first
- Care about every detail
- If a library can be replaced with 50=< LOC, replace it.
- Avoid dependencies unless absolutely essential.
- Don’t use anything you don’t understand.
- Prefer native APIs and first-party tools.
---

## 2. ERGONOMIFY _Delightful to use_
- Refine until UX feels like a **Game**
- Show don't tell
- Build flexible
- Build modular
---

## 3. TRANSPARENTIFY __Know what's happening right away__
- You're not writing code — **you're creating machines**.
- Think in terms of **Projects & Machines**, not Hardware/Software.
- Vertical integrate as possible. 
- Full-control the tech stack as possible.
