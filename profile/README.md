# MY BUILDER CREED

## 1. SIMPLICITY    ->   _Fewest parts as possible_
- DELETE ANYTHING NON-ESSENTIAL.
- USE SIMPLEST TECH FIRST.
- IF A LIB CAN BE REPLACED WITH 50<= LOC, REPLACE IT.
- AVOID DEPS UNLESS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.
- DON'T USE ANYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- AUTOMATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
- IMPERFECT IS PERFECT.

## 2. ERGONOMICS    ->  _Easy to work with_
- CARE ABOUT EVERY DETAIL.
- REFINE IT UNTIL IT FEELS LIKE A **GAME**.
- SHOW, DON'T TELL.
- THINK IN TERMS OF **PROJECTS & MACHINES** NOT HARDWARE/SOFTWARE.

## 3. RELIABILITY   ->  _20y time-proof_
- BUILD AS IF IT HAD TO ENDURE AT LEAST 20y.
- LOW-LEVEL > HIGH-LEVEL.
- NATIVE > 3rd-PARTY.
- NO FRAMEWORK > FRAMEWORK.
- NEVER OUTSOURCE A CORE PROCESS.
- VERTICAL INTEGRATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. 
- FULL-CONTROL THE TECH STACK.

## 4. MODULARITY    ->  _Flexible & Scalable_
- DVIDE PROCESS INTO SMALLER INTERCONNECTED PARTS. 
- AVOID OVER-EXTENSION.
- DECENTRALIZE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
- FLEXIBLE INDEPENDENT UNITS.
